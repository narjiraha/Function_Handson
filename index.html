    <h3>Q.1/ Create one function with zero parameter having a console statement;</h3>
    <pre>
    <b>ANS</b>:function sum() {
    let a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    let c = a + b;
    console.log(c)
    }
    sum();

    <b>Explanation</b>:
    This code defines a function named sum1. Within this function, two variables are declared, a and b, and assigned values
    of 10 and 20, respectively. Then, the values of a and b are added together and assigned to a new variable c. Finally,
    the result of the addition, which is stored in c, is printed to the console using console.log.

    When the function sum1 is called using sum1(); in the last line, it executes the code inside the function and logs the
    result of the addition, which is 30.
</pre>

    <h3>Q.2/ Create one function which takes two values as a parameter and print the sum of them as "Sum of 3, 4 is 7"
    </h3>
    <pre>
    <b>ANS</b>
    7

    <b>Explanation</b>:
    This code defines a function named sum that takes no parameters. Inside the function body, there is a single statement
    that logs the message "Sum of 3, 4 is 7" to the console using the console.log() method after calling the sum function.
</pre>

    <h3>Q.3 Create one arrow function</h3>
    <pre>
    <b>ANS</b>:
    7

    <b>Explanation</b>: This arrow function is called sumOF that takes two parameters a and b. The arrow => is used to define the function body,
    which simply returns the sum of a and b.
</pre>

    <h3>Q.4/

        "Print output:
        var x = 21;
        girl ();
        console.log(x)
        function girl() {
        console.log(x);
        var x = 20;
        };"
    </h3>
    <pre>
        <b>ANS</b>
        Undefined

        <b>Explanation</b>:The code defines a global variable x with the value 21. Then, it defines a function girl that logs a variable x to the
        console. Inside the function, a new variable x is declared with the value 20, but it only has function scope and is not
        the same as the global variable x. When the function is called and logs the variable x, the local variable x has not yet
        been assigned a value, so it logs undefined to the console.
    </pre>

    <h3>Q.5/ "Print output:
        var x = 21;
        girl ();
        console.log(x)
        function girl() {
        console.log(x);
        var x = 20;
        };
        "</h3>

    <pre>
            <b>ANS</b>:
            undefined
            21

            <b>Explanation</b>:In this code there is a global variable x with the value 21. It then calls the girl() function, which logs a variable x to
            the console.
            
            When girl() is called, it logs undefined to the console because the local x has not yet been assigned a value. After the
            function call, the global x value is logged to the console, which is 21.
        </pre>

    <h3>Q.6 / "Print output

        var x = 21;
        a();
        b();

        function a() {

        x = 20;
        console.log(x);
        };
        function b() {

        x = 40;
        console.log(x);
        };"</h3>

    <pre>
            <b>ANS</b>
            20
            40
            
            <b>Explanation</b>: This code creates a global variable x with the value 21. It then calls two functions a() and b() that both manipulate
            the value of x and log it to the console.
            
            The function a() assigns x a value of 20 and logs it to the console. This changes the global value of x from 21 to 20.
            
            The function b() then assigns x a value of 40 and logs it to the console. This further changes the global value of x
            from 20 to 40.
        </pre>

    <h3>
        Q.7/ Write a function that accepts parameter n and returns factorial of n
    </h3>

    <pre>
        <b>ANS:</b>
        120

        function factorial(n) {
        let result = 1;
        
        for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i; 
        }

        return result;
        }
        console.log(factorial(5)); 

        <b>Explanation:     </b>
        This function uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of n. It starts with a result of 1 and then multiplies it by
        every number from 1 to n.
    </pre>

    <h3>Q.8/
        "Guess the Output

        function FindSum(a, b){
        return a + b;
        }

        function DisplayData(data, batch){
        console.log(`i am from ${data} and My batch is EA${batch}`)
        }

        DisplayData(""PrepBytes"", FindSum(10, 9));"
    </h3>

    <pre>
        <b>ANS:</b>
        i am from PrepBytes and My batch is EA19"


        "Guess the Output
        
        function FindSum(a, b){
        return a + b;
        }
        
        function DisplayData(data, batch){
        console.log(`i am from ${data} and My batch is EA${batch}`)
        }
        
        DisplayData(""PrepBytes"", FindSum(10, 9));"

        <b>Explanation:</b>
        The code has two functions: "FindSum" and "DisplayData".
        
        The "FindSum" function takes two parameters "a" and "b" and returns the sum of their values using the addition operator.
        So if I call the function with the arguments "10" and "9", it will return the value as "19".
        
        The code calls the "DisplayData" function with the arguments "PrepBytes" and the result of calling "FindSum"
        with the arguments "10" and "9". This means that the "FindSum" function will return the value "19", and that value will
        be passed as the second argument to "DisplayData". As a result, the final output displayed in the console will be "i am
        from PrepBytes and My batch is EA19".
    </pre>


    <h3>Q.9/
        "Guess the output

        Abc();
        const Abc = function(){
        let value = 20;
        console.log(value);
        }"
    </h3>

    <pre>
        <b>ANS:</b>
        Error

        Abc();
        const Abc = function () {
        let value = 20;
        console.log(value);
        };

        <b>Explanation:</b>
        This code will result in an error because the function "Abc" is declared using a function expression which is assigned
        to a variable using the "const" keyword.
        
        When the program starts running, the "Abc()" function is called before it is declared. However, function expressions are
        not hoisted like function declarations, meaning that they cannot be called before they are defined. So it will through an error.
    </pre>

    <h3>Q.10/
        "Guess the output

        var a = 10;
        (function (){
        console.log(a);
        var a = 20;
        })();"
    </h3>

    <pre>
        <b>ANS:</b>
        Undefined

        var a = 10;
        (function () {
        console.log(a);
        var a = 20;
        })();

        <b>Explanation:</b>
        The output of this code is "undefined" because of variable hoisting, which causes the declaration of "a" to be moved to
        the top of the function scope, but its value is not assigned until later in the function.
    </pre>

    <h3>Q.11/
        "Guess the Output
        const greet = function(name){
        return function(m){

        console.log(`Hi!! ${name}, ${m}`);
        }
        }

        const greet_message = greet('EA19');
        greet_message(""Welcome To PrepBytes"")"
